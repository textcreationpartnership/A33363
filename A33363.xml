            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Have alwayes thought, ſince I conſidered and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what <hi>Popery</hi> was, that the knowing of it would be a ſufficient Diſſwaſive from it, to thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard God and their Souls.

            <p>I intend not here to impeach any <hi>Maxime</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> but that Doctrine of the Romaniſts which is far more extenſive, delivered by <hi>Canoniſts</hi> and <hi>Divines Secular</hi> and <hi>Regular</hi> of every ſort, and in part by the <hi>Canon Low</hi> and their <hi>Councils</hi> (who ſometimes glance at this Subject, though they make it not their buſineſs;) <hi>that</hi> which in moſt particulars, and thoſe of greateſt moment, is ancienter than the <hi>Society;</hi> and in many points ſuch, as the Cenſurers of the Jeſuites Morality do not touch, but either approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or dare not condemn, leaſt they ſhould involve the whole Church in the Condemnation. I cannot diſcern that the Practical Divinity of the Jeſuites is more corrupt, then that of other Romiſh Writers, their Contemporaries: And thoſe that view the <hi>Moral Diſcourſes</hi> of both, and compare them, will (if I much miſtake not) diſcern no other. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet met with any Author of that Order, ſo intollerably licentious, but might be matched, if not out-vied by others: there is no need to except <hi>Eſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Onely becauſe it is requiſite to ſhew their concurrence in ſome Points, which otherwiſe might not paſs for the Common Doctrine, I make uſe of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> freely (whom none can count a Corrupter of Popery, however Chriſtianity hath been treated by him:) and of <hi>Suarez</hi> ſometimes (whoſe Judgment alone is counted equivalent to a thouſand others, by ſome <note n="(o)" place="bottom">Vid.

I alledge beſide; though rarely, one or two more of thoſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> of like eminency and authority, in that Church: but none of them, ſave in ſuch points wherein they have not been noted for extravagancies by others; or in ſuch wherein thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Orders</hi> concurre with, or go beyond them. The greateſt advantage I make of them, is, to repreſent the opinions of others, not their own; and moſt herein of <hi>Suarez,</hi> who uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gives an account of the <hi>Common Doctrine</hi> out of unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable <hi>Authors:</hi> Thoſe whom I principally rely on to make good the Charge, are the ancienter and better ſort of their Divines and Caſuiſts (the ſtrictect of them in points of Morality that I could meet with) ſuch as are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſciples of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that moſt of them are <hi>Dominicans</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60921:4"/> (moſt oppoſite of all <hi>Orders</hi> to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and ſaid to be the leaſt tainted with theſe Corruptions) and the greateſt part of them were <hi>Writers</hi> before their <hi>Order</hi> was founded, or appeared to the World on this Subject. To theſe I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded other <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> of this laſt Age, not that there is need to produce any worſe than the former, but to ſhew that time hath made little or no alteration amongſt them for the better.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> when they are aſhamed of their Doctrine, or think the World will cry ſhame of it, are wont to <hi>diſown</hi> it. It is like they may do ſo here, and tell us that theſe points not being determined by Councils, are not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their Church, but the opinions of particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. This ſerves them for a ſhift in other caſes with ſome colour, but it will be abſurd to offer at it here. For though this be not <hi>their Doctrine of Faith,</hi> which with ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals moſt about the Sacraments (reflected on in the ſequel as there is occaſion) is the buſineſs of their <hi>Councils:</hi> yet it is the <hi>Practical Doctrine</hi> of their Church, if it have any, and f they think their <hi>Catholicks</hi> concerned to be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> more than meerly in opinion. And this under ſeveral Heads, I have collected out of ſuch Writings, as are the proper place of it. Therefore to ſay that this is not the Doctrine of their Church, becauſe the particulars are not found decided by Councils, is to tell us, that they are not charged with it, unleſs we can find it, where they know it cannot be found, and where with any reaſon, it cannot be looked for. It is no more reaſonable, than if one who hath taken a purſe, ſhould plead, though it be found in his hand, that he is not to be charged with it, unleſs we can ſpy it in his mouth, when yet he never opens it. That Councils ſhould give particular Directions for Conſcience and Practice, in Caſes
<pb facs="tcp:60921:5"/> innumerable, was never attempted, nor ever can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ed. Their Church leaves this to her Divines and Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts; and that nothing may paſs them but what is agreeable to her ſenſe, no Books are to be publiſhed, but with the approbation and authority of ſuch as are counted competent Judges hereof. So that the Doctrine of their authorized Writers, that eſpecially wherein they commonly agree; is the <hi>Practical Doctrine</hi> of that Church, or elſe ſhe hath none ſuch, and conſequently no care of the lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of her Members. And though this be not Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or <hi>de fide,</hi> as they count the Deciſions of Councils; yet is it as certain they ſay, as the nature of the ſubject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; nor do they pretend to have any infallible Doctrine, for particular directions herein. Which yet may juſtly ſeem very ſtrange to any man that conſiders that groſs faults in Life and Practice are more infallibly damnable than errours in Faith and Speculation. Now upon this their Common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine the ſubſtance of the Charge enſuing, and the principal articles thereof are grounded. As for the opinions of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Doctors, wherein there is no ſuch common concurrence, though they be not ſo certain as the other, yet they are (even the worſt of them) <hi>ſafe</hi> in practice; any of their people may follow them without danger, and with a good conſcience: for this (as will appear hereafter) is the common judgement of their Schools and Doctors, and ſo far the Doctrine of their Church. And if that Church did no farther own theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, common or particular, then under this character; this is enough for our purpoſe (when the queſtion is of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Popery in reference to mens Salvation) that ſhe counts ſuch rules of life <hi>ſafe,</hi> and publickly allows them as directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for practice, which tend to ruin Religion and mens Souls. If they were not counted <hi>ſafe,</hi> that Church which pretends
<pb facs="tcp:60921:5"/> to ſo much care of Souls, ſince all in her Communion are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the <hi>Danger,</hi> would be concerned to give warning of it, and brand theſe <hi>Maximes</hi> as pernicious: but this was never yet done, not ever like to be. Theſe opinions, all, or the greateſt part of them; were taught and publiſhed in that Church, before the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> there was time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in Eighteen years, to take cognizance of them and their pernicious conſequence: Yet when they beſtowed <hi>Anathama</hi>'s ſo liberally, where there was occaſion (and for the moſt part) where there was none; they thought not fit to beſtow one <hi>Curſe</hi> upon theſe Doctrines, how execrable ſo ever: yea ſome part thereof of worſe conſequence, had there an expreſs Confirmation. Their Popes ſince, though they could ſee occaſion to condemn ſuch Propoſitions as the Five aſcribed to <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Baius, White,</hi> and many others: could not, by the help of a judgement counted infallible, diſcern any thing in the worſt of theſe Doctrines, worthy of or fit for their Cenſure. The <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and their <hi>Setters</hi> in other Countries, whoſe buſineſs it is to ſpie whatever (in Books particularly) is againſt <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good Manners;</hi> ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature in that which deſtroys both.

It's true, ſome others have been expunged, and I find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Forty Opinions of the late <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> cenſured by <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Seventh,</hi> and the Cardinals of their <hi>Sacred Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There is no ground to expect that this Doctrine, as to the principal and moſt pernicious parts of it, will ever be condemned by any <hi>Popes</hi> or <hi>Councils</hi> of ſuch Complexion and Principles as that of <hi>Trent,</hi> where it was a <hi>Maxime</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved religiouſly, that no Determination ſhould paſs, which either in matter or form, would diſoblige any conſiderable <hi>Party</hi> among them, <hi>much leſs all:</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> intereſt is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſuch Politicks, and muſt be ſecured whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Souls or Saving Doctrine. There are indeed ſome Diſſenters amongſt them (as there are elſewhere) who <hi>complain</hi> of their <hi>Moral Divinity;</hi> but they are ſuch, whoſe power and intereſt, can reach little further than <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;</hi> and theſe are ſo far from being the Voice or Senſe of their Church, that their Writings which exhibite ſuch Complaints, are condemned at <hi>Rome</hi> 
               <note n="(q)" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> by the Supreme Tribunal (as they call it) of the Inquiſition.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, by the known Cuſtom and ſettled Order of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the people for regulating of their Hearts and Lives, are to be directed by their <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors have their direction herein from their <hi>Caſuists</hi> and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Authors: both Prieſts and People muſt believe this to be <hi>ſafe;</hi> becauſe the Church hath made this proviſion for them, approves the courſe, and obligeth them to take no other. And thus that Doctrine, the deadly Venome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I here diſcover, muſt be conveyed from their Caſuiſts to
<pb facs="tcp:60921:6"/> all ſorts amongſt them; nor muſt they fear any danger in it, unleſs they will queſtion the wiſdom and goodneſs of their Church. There can be no queſtion, but that this Doctrine is thus far owned by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered fallibly or infallibly, by Councils or without, is not at all here conſiderable: It is enough that ſuch is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct provided for Roman Catholicks, and that it is to be followed without apprehenſion of danger, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined by thoſe that will keep the ordinary road of that Church, though it lead directly to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>When no other ſhift will ſerve, to hinder thoſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undeceived whom they would delude, it is uſual with them, to make loud out-cries of falſe <hi>Citations,</hi> and that their Doctrine is miſrepreſented. I have been very careful to give no juſt occaſion for this; being apprehenſive that he who doth it, wrongs not them more than he doth himſelf and his Cauſe. The places cited I have viewed again and again, where there might be any doubt of miſconſtruction; and ſet down their own <hi>words</hi> where it might ſeem ſcarce cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that Chriſtians and Divines (directing Conſcience) ſhould ſpeak at ſuch a rate; and where that would have been too tedious, have given their <hi>ſenſe</hi> faithfully, ſo far as I could diſcern it, and directed the Reader where he may find and judge thereof himſelf. Yet, if notwithſtanding all the care and diligence I could uſe, it hath been my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, any where to miſtake them, upon notice from any I ſhall do them right: and am capable to give them further ſatisfaction, knowing well, that I am yet far from repreſenting their Doctrine fully ſo bad as it is. Large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes might be fill'd with the corruptions of it, I have but pointed at ſome; and contented my ſelf with few Authors in many particulars, where plenty might have been produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
<pb facs="tcp:60921:7"/> I deſigned briefneſs, and have waved much that was ready, leaſt I ſhould be tedious: conſidering that ſome who are moſt concerned in ſuch Diſcourſes, will have nothing at all, when they think too much is offered.</p>
            <p>I have been leſs ſolicitous about the Style, it doth not alwayes ſatisfie my ſelf, ſo that I can allow others to finde fault with it: It may be thought ſometimes <hi>leſs grave,</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where too <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>vehement.</hi> I ſuffered it to be, what the ſubject would have it; and the quality thereof now and then over-ruled me, ſomewhat againſt my own inclination. Onely I make nothing ridiculous, but find it ſo; and ſhould ſcarce do it right, if I repreſented it otherwiſe than it is. Where I ſeem too ſharp or ſevere upon any occaſion, I found ſomething in the nature of the Subject that forced me to it. And it is not eaſie (if it be congruous or juſt) to ſpeak of what is monſtrouſly extravagant, or pernicious, with ſuch calmneſs as we treat indifferent things.</p>
            <p>It will be enough for me, if (through Gods bleſſing) peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will hereby be brought to underſtand, that <hi>Popary</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns not to trouble them, either with the <hi>reality</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the happineſs which Chriſt has intailed thereon. And that their <hi>Practical Doctrine</hi> is contrived accordingly, will, I doubt not, be hereby manifeſt to all ſuch as have a mind to <hi>ſee,</hi> and are not willfully reſolved to loſe the way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and their ſouls together, by ſhutting their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo plain a diſcovery of ſo great a danger.</p>

True Religion will have God to be worſhipped really. Real worſhip requires the concurrence of mind and heart. In their Divine Service they require no act of the <hi>Will,</hi> but an <hi>Intention</hi> beforehand to attend their ſervice is enough, though they be not Attentive when they are at it. An in tentionto <hi>worſhip God</hi> there is ſcarce needful. Their intention may be effectual, though they act contrary to it. They may imploy both Soul and Body about other things when they are at their Prayers. The act of the <hi>mind</hi> which they ſeem to require is <hi>Attention;</hi> but this need not be either <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Rational;</hi> So that they <hi>need not mind God</hi> in their Prayers, nor the things to be prayed for, nor the ſenſe of the words they uſe; but only the pronouncing of them, nor need they <hi>actually</hi> mind that. The Churches holineſs ſupplyes their Defects, and makes thoſe paſs as ſuch that pray devoutly, who pray not at all. All due Attention in Worſhip is not only unneceſſary, but impoſſible in their way. As Attention, ſo inward <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is not neceſſary in their Service. Hereby their Worſhip is no better than a Prophane irreligious exerciſe; They ſeem ſatisfied with leſs Worſhip for God, than for their Images, <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>to page</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Maſs</hi> by their Doctrine God may be leſs minded, than in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical hours, where they tell us he need not be minded at all. No <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Worſhip requiſite in the Maſs. It is enough if their attendance there be but an humane act. Nay the uſe either of Senſe or Reaſon is not there required. They may buſie themſelves in other imployments
<pb facs="tcp:60921:8"/> while they are at Maſs. They may ſleep a while, or laugh if they be not too loud. Or talk of their worldly affairs all the while ſay ſome; others would not have their Diſcourſe ſo ſerious: yea it may be immodeſt without tranſgreſſing the Precept. And laſcivious or very prophane Tunes to the Organ at Maſs may be a ſmall fault. The Precept for Maſs (the chief part of their Religirn) may be fulfilled by mortal wickedneſs, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>page</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>Of their <hi>ends</hi> in Worſhip; They may lawfully Worſhip God for their own ends. Sin may be their end in Worſhipping, and that without ſin, if not principally intended. It is but a ſmall fault to Worſhip God princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for vain Glory. He that comes to Maſs or Prayer with a deſign to ſatisfie his Luſt, or other mortal wickedneſs, ſatisfies the command of the Church, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>to page</hi> 43.</p>

               <p>In their Sacraments no good motions or actual diſpoſitions (ſuch as are neceſſary in real Worſhippers) are required by that Church in any that Adminiſter or partake thereof. This ſhewed as to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Penance</hi> the Sacraments for the <hi>Dead.</hi> Alſo in the other five for the <hi>living.</hi> In all, the precepts of the Church may be fully accompliſhed by impious and wicked acts, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>to page</hi> 48.</p>
               <p>Even as to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> (for which they profeſs they have the higheſt veneration) they may partake worthily, who are without any the leaſt good act of mind or heart. And to ſhut out good motions from their Souls, on ſet purpoſe, when they are communicating, is but a venial fault; ſuch as will not hinder the effects of the Sacrament. Thoſe vagaries which are inconſiſtent with <hi>Attention</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> if they be not taken notice of, will be no fault at all; if they be deliberate, will but be ſlight ones. Not only Reverence and Devotion are accounted need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at this Sacrament; but Sobriety and the uſe of Reaſon. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate out of oſtentation and vain glory is but a peccadillo. And all holy fervor being excluded by voluntary diſtraction; to imploy their Souls vainly or wickedly, during the Celebration is no fault at all, in reference to the Sacrament. Thoſe that communicate unworthily, to ſuch a degree as is counted moſt horridly impious; do fully ſatisfie the precept of their Church for the Communion, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>to page</hi> 52.</p>

               <p>Their Doctrine doth not more oblige them to Worſhip God in private. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> not neceſſary, no not on the holieſt ſeaſons, or occaſions. <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the word of God ſcarce tolerated in the people, and that not ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Stews, <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>to page</hi> 53.</p>

                  <hi>Private Prayer</hi> rarely a duty with ſome, never a duty with others. Not at all by their common Doctrine, but by accident, in the Article of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which many never meet with: ſo that many may never pray while they live, and yet be innocent. Some ſay there is no Divine precept for Prayer; Others who ackowledg a precept, will not have it oblige them, at ſuch times and occaſions when, if ever, it would oblige. Even in their Article of neceſſity when it comes, they have ways to excuſe them eaſily from the obligation, and to make it no ſpecial ſin to neglect this duty all their life, <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. <hi>to page</hi> 59.</p>
               <p>Their Church obliges not any to private prayers, not to the leaſt, or thoſe of moſt account among them. When ever they uſe private prayer upon any account, as required by precept, or injoyned for pennance (for Prayer paſſes commonly with them as a puniſhment), or voluntary as a work of Supererogation: there is no need by their principles to worſhip God therein. Seeing they are to Worſhip him no more any where, the World may judge what Religion they have; ſince that Worſhip is as eſſential to Religion, as a Soul to a man, <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. <hi>to page</hi> 63.</p>

               <p>THeir Doctrine makes it needleſs to <hi>love</hi> God. There is no command for <hi>habitual</hi> love to God. The acts of this love are as unneceſſary.

               <p>How needleſs the <hi>Elicite</hi> acts of this love are. Some hold there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for this actual love (any inward act of it) that binds them, or no ſpecial command. Others who acknowledg a precept, will not have it to bind them upon any occaſion, when, if ever, it would oblige. Not when they have ſinn'd againſt him. Not when he expreſſes his love. Not when he diſcovers his infinite Excellencies to them. Not when they are to worſhip him. Not at any Sacrament, no not the Euchariſt. It is too much to love God once a Week, or once a Year, or once in Four or Five Years. One act of love once in a life may be enough; yea and more than needs too, for when that time comes (if ever it come) when they will have any obliged to an act of love; yet they then aſſign ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, which will ſerve inſtead of it, and ſo render it needleſs ſtill. A love which is the iſſue of nature unſanctified may ſuffice. Or to love God leſs than other things, only more than mortal crimes, may be enough. Or to do nothing againſt this love, though there be no acts <hi>of</hi> it or <hi>from</hi> it, may be ſufficient. Or external acts may ſatisfie.

               <p>NO neceſſity of true Repentance for any ſort of ſins by their Doctrine. Of <hi>original</hi> ſin, or the corruption of our natures no man can be obliged to Repent, <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>to page</hi> 121.</p>
               <p>It is as needleſs for thoſe many (and divers of them horrid ſins,) which they count <hi>venial.</hi> What pretty expedients they have to expiate theſe, without Repentance, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>to page</hi> 123.</p>
               <p>For mortal ſins ſome teach there is no Divine command to Repent. And ſo to live and dye impenitently, will be no Tranſgreſſion. No need of it any way, either as a <hi>duty</hi> injoyn'd, or as a <hi>Medium, Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>to page</hi> 125.</p>
               <p>Others who confeſs there is a command for it, will not have it oblige any ſinner preſently. No ſin nor danger to defer Repentance. Nor will they have it needful at ſuch times and occaſions, which, if any, would be the neceſſary ſeaſons for it. Not at ſolemn times of Worſhip. Not on days of faſting. Not when viſited with great calamities. Not when ſins are brought to their Remembrance.

               <p>No need to Repent till one be at the point of death. Nor is it ſo needful then, or any time before, but ſomething elſe may ſerve without it. A Repentance without any ſenſible ſorrow for, or actual reſolution againſt ſin is ſufficient. Or a penitence merely natural may ſuffice. Or a ſlight remorſe in the loweſt degree poſſible, one act of it, diſpatch'd in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and never repeated, will be enough. Or if a man conceive that he truly repents, though really he does not, this may ſerve the turn. Or if he know that he does not repent ſufficiently, yet if he ſignifie that he would grieve more, and is ſorry that he does not, this will be effectual. Or attrition with the Sacrament will unqueſtionably juſtifie him. Attrition with them far diſtant from true Repentance. Several ſorts of it. Any of them ſeem ſufficient by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concurrence of their Divines for the ſufficiency of Attrition; yet the beſt ſort of it confeſſed to be morally evil, <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. <hi>to page</hi> 144.</p>

               <p>When they have excluded true Repentance by Attrition, they reduce At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition to nothing; yet will have it ſtill ſufficient. The leaſt ſervile diſlike of ſin in the loweſt degree, though it be gone in a moment, though it be merely natural, is enough. Or if there be but a diſlike, that this diſlike is wanting.

               <p>THeir Doctrine leaves no neceſſity of Holineſs of life. It is enough to denominate their univerſal Church holy, if there be but one holy man in it. One act of charity, the leaſt of all, may make one a holy man. Other Maxims of this tendency. How they deſtroy the neceſſity of holy life, by making it needleſs to <hi>exerciſe vertue,</hi> and <hi>avoid ſin, Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>to page</hi> 154.</p>
               <p>How they make the exerciſe of Chriſtian vertues unneceſſary in general, more particularly <hi>hope</hi> (one of the three Divine vertues) fares no better, than <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> They leave themſelves no good ground of hope. Their hope a Conjecture, founded upon a deluſion. The precept for hope obliges not, but in the more grievous aſſaults of deſpair. So that not one of a Thouſand in Popery need have any hope in God. No
<pb facs="tcp:60921:11"/> not any, ſince the command for it may be ſatisfied by other acts, <hi>Sct.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>page</hi> 157.</p>
               <p>Their Doctrine leaves no room for, no ground of <hi>Humility,</hi> no ſenſe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, weakneſs, unworthineſs. 'Tis pregnant with Pride and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>to page</hi> 159.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brotherly love</hi> unneceſſary by their Doctrine. No need of love to any, unleſs in neceſſity. Nor then, though the neceſſity be extreme, if we help them, though not out of Chriſtian love. This extended not only to external, but ſpiritual neceſſities. If the acts whereby we ſhould relieve their Souls be neglected, it may paſs for a ſmall fault. Thoſe who have no Chriſtian love, if they believe they have it, may be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from ſin. No precept requires any ſpecial act of love to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. No affirmative command for ſuch love. 'Tis enough that we do nothing againſt them, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>to page</hi> 162.</p>
               <p>In deſtroying the neceſſity of thoſe radical Graces inſtanced in before, they root out the reſt. Particularly thoſe that depend upon love to God, <hi>viz. Delight</hi> in God, <hi>deſires</hi> to injoy him, <hi>hatred</hi> of ſin, <hi>ſorrow</hi> for it as an offence to God, and <hi>filial fear.</hi> By their common Doctrine there's no ſpecial command for any fear of God. So that the want of all fear of God, filial or ſervile, is no ſpecial ſin. Since they need not act out of love, they exempt themſelves from all acts truly Chriſtian, and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtianity than honeſt Heatheniſm. All exerciſe of vertues op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to acts accounted but venially evil, is with them needleſs.

               <p>A ſpecial expedient, whereby they make the exerciſe of Chriſtian vertues unneceſſary, is their turning the commands of God into <hi>Counſels,</hi> ſuch as need not be obſerved. Such they count many of thoſe excellent rules in Chriſt's Sermon on the Mount. Theſe and many others ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. More inſtances in vertues, which concern our <hi>ſelves, God</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> in acts of temperance and contentment, in acts of Religion, and in acts of Righteouſneſs and Mercy. Alſo <hi>Mortification, crucifying the World, ſelf-denyal, taking up the Croſs, and all growth</hi> in grace is but matter of Counſel. So is every degree of grace, above the loweſt of all. Yea all commands for good acts are no more than Counſels, but only in the article of neceſſity. And all acts that have more than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goodneſs. And all actings in a vertuous manner, and from a good principle. Exerciſe of vertue not neceſſary either in Worſhip, or common
<pb facs="tcp:60921:11"/> converſation. Not in thoſe caſes, where, if in any at all it would be needful. A way they have for any man to turn whatever precept pinches him, into a <hi>Counſel.</hi> There is no danger, nor any ſin at all in rejecting the counſel of God. No not when Conſcience dictates that it is good to follow them. No nor when God further calls thereto by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or motions of his Spirit. They may be neglected out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. And with ſome abhorrence of them. They may boaſt and glory in ſuch neglects.

               <p>No exerciſe of vertue neceſſary, but only during the Pope's pleaſure, for if be ſhould forbid vertue (as he hath done already in diverſe inſtances) the Church would be bound to believe thoſe vertues to be evils and ſo to avoid them.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon what occaſion they may <hi>kill</hi> one another. A man may with impunity kill his Wife taken in Adultery, or his Daughter, or Siſter, or his own Mother: and this thougb they be big with child. A woman married or unmarried being unlawfully got with child, may procure Abortion; not only to ſecure her life, but her ſtate and credit. It is lawful to cut up an honeſt Mother quick, and ſhe bound to procure it, that the child in her womb do not want Baptiſm. They may without ſin kill any one aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting them unjuſtly, not only to ſecure their life, but to avoid a wound or a blow (a Prieſt may do it while he is Celebrating) though the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor be frantick or in drink, or aſleep. Or though he have had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable provocation, and be the ſufferer. They may kill an innocent
<pb facs="tcp:60921:15"/> to eſcape themſelves. They may kill one before he actually aſſaults them (though his Soul be like to periſh with his life) if they know he is prepared for it, or does but deſign it. So the Adultereſs may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her Husband, and kill him firſt, with the poyſon or weapon prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for her. They may kill one to ſecure their Goods, or recover them, when they may be recovered in a legal way. Yea though they be of ſmall value, worth but three or four Duckets, yea but one Crown or leſs. They may kill men for their Reputation. If he ſees one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to aſſault him he may kill him, rather than retire. A blow with a Cudgel, or a light Switch, yea or a box on the ear, is a juſt ground to kill him that gives it; yea or does but offer at it. They may kill men for ill language, though they allow it to be as common, as any they ſpeak. Yea for an affront by mere ſigns, though he that gives ſuch an affront runs for it. They ſpeak favourably of Duels. But allow them to kill men more privily, and by ſurprize, when they impeach their Reputation publickly or privately; yea or do but threaten to do it. Jeſuits ſcarce ſo extravagant here, as ſome of other Orders. If the civil law did but give ſo much liberty to murder, as their rules for Conſcience, no man near them, could have ſecurity for his life, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>to page</hi> 337.</p>

Publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes compelled by law, to commit lewdneſs with any that will hire them. Hence the people (inſtructed in their Religion) know not that ſuch Fornication is a ſin. He that keeps a Concubine at home is not to be denyed the Communion. Nor will they oblige him to put her away, if that would impair his Eſtate, or Delight, or his Reputation, yea or hers either. It is enough if he promiſe not to ſin with her, though he keep not promiſe. <hi>Adultery</hi> no ſin in diverſe caſes. For the Clergy, Adultery, nor unnatural uncleanneſs not ſo much a ſin as Marriage. Burning luſt, innocent. Better to burn than to marry, whatever the Apoſtle with their Adverſaries ſay. The admired chaſtity of their votaries conſiſts well enough with whoredom, and is only violated by Marriage. Their Prieſts have been allowed to keep whores at home, paying a yearly Rent for it. And thoſe were to pay it who took not the liberty, becauſe they might. Votaries incurr excommunication for laying aſide their habit, but not if they lay it aſide to commit Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more readily. Prieſts in no wiſe to be obliged by Oath to forſake their Concubines. Extremely few chaſt, by their own confeſſion, of thoſe innumerably many that profeſs it.

Their Clergy may act it to the uttermoſt, and be neither ſuſpended, nor irregular, unleſs they make a Trade of it, and do that ſo publickly and notoriouſly, as they can ſcarce do (by their deſcription hereof), if they had a mind to it.

                  <hi>GOod works</hi> not neceſſary by the Roman Doctrine. This ſhewed in <hi>Faſting, Prayer, Alms-deeds,</hi> to which they reduce all good works. They do not, they need not <hi>faſt</hi> on their faſting days. Their Church requires the obſervance of none of thoſe things, which they ſay are neceſſary to the being of a faſt. They may eat a Dinner, a full meal at noon, may be exceſſive therein, ſo as to tranſgreſs the laws of Sobriety, and to excite and cheriſh luſt, inſtead of repreſſing the fleſh; and yet fulfil the precept. They may break their faſt in the morning (and yet keep it) with Ale, Wine, Bread, or other things. They may eat a Supper too, and that exceſſive great, as big as cuſtome will have it, when they tell us, it is their cuſtome to ſup with notorious exceſs. They may ſup out of ſenſuality. And may take their ſupper in the morning. And drink and eat every hour. The quality of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting meat moſt delicious. They may drink at any time and Wine too (though that is confeſſed to be more contrary to a faſt than fleſh). They may drink it till they be drunk, and yet not break their faſt. Nothing Religious in their faſt. Neither Religious ends nor imployments. And ſo it can be no good work nor neceſſary in their account. Thoſe that have tyred themſelves with Gaming or Whoring are excuſed. Yet this piece of mockery paſſes with them as ſatisfactory and meritorious, <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>to page</hi> 397.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>praying</hi> no good work. The people pray not in the Maſs. They neither expreſs nor conceive any Petitions. Nor concur with the Prieſt, but by preſence and poſture of the body, as an image may do, or by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually wiſhing the Prieſts prayers may ſucceed, which they may do, when they are aſleep. Nor do their Prieſts pray better in their publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, unleſs the bare pronouncing of the words (which is all they count neceſſary) be praying. How far they acknowledg this, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>to page</hi> 401.</p>
               <p>Acts of <hi>mercy</hi> or <hi>charity</hi> not neceſſary with them, but in two caſes, which ſeldom or rather never occurr, at leaſt together. One is when they have ſuperfluities both in reſpect of nature and ſtate, but, they ſay, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be judged, that any ſecular perſon (no nor Kings and Princes)
<pb facs="tcp:60921:18"/> have ſuch ſuperfluities. The other is when the neceſſity is extreme (except it be ſuch if any had ſuperfluities, they would not be obliged to part with any thing.) When it is extreme, they allow the poor to ſteal. So charity is not needful but when ſtealing is lawful. Or then he may be excuſed ſo many ways, that he need never find himſelf obliged to relieve any <hi>gratis.</hi> Good works not neceſlary with them, becauſe to act from a good principle, and for a good end, is needleſs. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſatisfie juſtice, and merit grace and glory by what they do, makes their pretended good works, deadly evils. No neceſſity of good works upon the account of their being injoyned for <hi>pennance.</hi> So they are not done as good, but ſuffered as evils. Beſides the Prieſt need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn ſuch. Or the ſinner need not ſubmit thereto, or need not perform it. But may be releaſed many ways. Eſpecially by Indulgencies. 'Tis counted better to give money for theſe, than in ways of charity, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>to page</hi> 408.</p>
               <p>The <hi>concluſion</hi> where from the premiſes in brief, is inferred, that the practical Doctrine of the Romaniſts tends to ruine Chriſtianity, and the Souls of all that follow it.</p>

               <p>THe danger of Popery in points of Faith hath been ſufficiently diſcovered to the world, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the Reformation; but their Doctrine which concerns Life and Practice, hath not been ſo much inſiſted on. And yet there is as much occaſion for this; for here the miſchief is as great; an unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian heart and life being at leaſt as damning as erronious belief: and hereby the great Apoſtacy and degeneracy of the Papal Church is as apparent: and herein they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with as much diſregard of Chriſt, and the ſouls of men. Their <hi>deſign</hi> in this, ſeems to have been, not the promoting of Chriſts intereſt (for that is manifeſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted;) but the ſecuring and greatning of a Faction, which under the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, might be falſe to all its realities. And their rule is the corrupt inclinations of depraved nature, to which they have throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their practical Divinity; which eaſeth it of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for which it hath an averſation, how much ſoever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; and clears its way to thoſe ſins, to which it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as though there were no need to avoid them. This <hi>Rule</hi> ſerves their deſign with great advantage, but ſouls are more endangered hereby, and their principles become more pernitious, becauſe they are ſo taking. Perſwade a man, that he may ſafely neglect the duties, which he owes to God, his own ſoul, and others; and may gratify the <hi>luſts</hi> he is addicted to; and give him the maximes of Religion,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60921:21"/> and the Authority and Concluſions of Divines, and the Teachers whom he truſts, for it: and he will <hi>like</hi> that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, becauſe he <hi>loves</hi> his ſin, and is in danger to follow <hi>both,</hi> though he periſh for it eternally. And indeed this is it which makes the condition of Papiſts deplorable, for though the principles of their <hi>belief,</hi> as it is Popiſh, be mortally poyſonous; yet there might be ſome Antidote in the <hi>practicalls</hi> of Chriſtianity, retained, and followed, by thoſe who are unavoidably ignorant of the danger of their more ſpeculative errours; and ſo ſome hopes of ſuch: but their <hi>Practical Doctrine</hi> being no leſs corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>remedy</hi> it ſelf becomes <hi>poyſon,</hi> and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, who freely let it down, hopeleſs. Whether their errours in matters of Faith be directly fundamental, hath been, with ſome of their Oppoſers, a queſtion; but thoſe who well view their <hi>practical Doctrine,</hi> may diſcern, that it ſtrikes through the heart of Chriſtianity, caſting off the vitalls of it as ſuperfluities, and cuts of thoſe who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and follow it, from the way of life: not onely by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them, with ſecurity to live and die in all ſorts of wickedneſs; but alſo by obliging them to neglect, as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the greateſt, and moſt important concerns of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, without which God cannot be honoured by us, nor Salvation attained. This will be apparent, by obſerving what is determined in that Church, by thoſe who have the conduct of their lives and Conſciences, concerning the Worſhipping of God, Chriſtian knowledge, Love to God, Faith in Chriſt, Repentance from dead works, and Holineſs of life; as to the Exerciſe of Chriſtian Vertues, the Abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin, and the Practice of good works; of all which in particular the following diſcourſe gives an account.</p>

Hence Chriſt brands thoſe, who draw near to God with their lips, without their hearts, for hypocrites <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 7, 8. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 6. Such as pretend to be what they are not; and to do, what really they do not: who are but worſhippers in ſhew, and fiction; no more ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed than the Stage-Player is the Prince, whoſe part he acts. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſeem to acknowledg all this, and therefore ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that it is as neceſſary, that God ſhould be really worſhipped; as it is needful, that he ſhould have any honour in the world, or that there ſhould be any true Religion amongſt men, or Salvation for them. Yet notwithſtanding, <hi>their practical Doctrine makes it needleſs to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God really.</hi> That this may be fully and diſtinctly manifeſted, let us obſerve <hi>Firſt,</hi> what they count requiſite <hi>in Divine Service,</hi> and in their <hi>Maſs:</hi> the former is their worſhip for every day, (which goes under
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60921:22"/> the name of <hi>Canonical hours and the divine office</hi>) and is the proper Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Clergy and Monaſticks: the latter is for holy-daies, and is common to the People with the <hi>Religious;</hi> and the only publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they are ordinarily obliged to. Afterwards we may reflect upon, what elſe paſſeth under the notion of worſhip in publick; and alſo take ſome notice of their devotions, or religious employments, in private.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe their <hi>Divine Service,</hi> if there were any thing of religion or religious worſhip counted needful amongſt them, it would be required of their Clergy, and thoſe whom by way of eminency they call Religious, in their Divine office eſpecially (if any where): but by their doctrine it is not needful for them to worſhip God really there; unleſs he can be ſaid to be worſhipped where both himſelf and all that concerns worſhippers indeed, may (as it may by their leave) be quite neglected, and no way actually minded. They ſeem, at leaſt ſome of them, in their diſcourſes of worſhip, and prayer particularly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire as neceſſary thereto, both an act of the mind and of the will (<hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> they call them): but proceed with them a little, and you will find the former of theſe, quite loſt in the latter; and the latter, as they order it, dwindling into nothing. It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon determination of their Schools and Doctors, that <hi>actual attention</hi> of mind is not neceſſary when they recite their <hi>Canonical hours,</hi> that is, they need not mind <hi>God</hi> in their ſervice, nor the <hi>matter</hi> of it more than the object, nor the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of what they ſay, nor the <hi>words</hi> they uſe; not any of theſe need be actually minded. A purpoſe or intention to do it is ſufficient, though that purpoſe be not at all performed. This is the Doctrine of their great <hi>Aquinas</hi>

                     <hi>Prayer ought to be at leaſt attentive in reſpect of a previous intention.</hi> So that they may be <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive</hi> enough, by vertue of this <hi>firſt intention,</hi> though they do not at all mind afterwards what they are doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping: Which is juſt as if they ſhould ſay, a man that goes to Church, with an intent to join in their ſervice, but falls faſt aſleep when he comes there, ſerves God effectually, and is attentive enough, by vertue of that former intention, though he ſleep all the while. It ſeems it is ſufficient in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and effectual even to a degree meritorious, to worſhip God as one that is aſleep may worſhip him, if he falls aſleep after a <hi>good intention.</hi> However hereby it is manifeſt that with them it is not needful to <hi>worſhip</hi> God at all, even in their moſt ſolemn ſervice, but only to <hi>intend</hi> ſome ſuch thing. If there be a purpoſe of worſhip, though God be never worſhipped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by their doctrine, it is enough for him. I ſuppoſe his <hi>Holineſs</hi> would not think himſelf well ſerved at this rate. The common women at <hi>Rome</hi> are to pay him a <hi>julio</hi> a head, weekly for the liberty he gives them to drive <hi>their</hi> there trade; now if inſtead of payment, they ſhould alledge an intention of it, and declare this is all they are obliged to, and that they ought to be acquitted upon that account, though they never laid it down, he would think himſelf not paid hereby, but ſcorned; he looſeth his ſacred Reverence, and is affronted into the bargain: yet at this rate will he have God ſerved by Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. Well, but if God need not be worſhipped but in purpoſe only, and the intention may ſerve without the act: yet ſure it muſt be an <hi>actual intention,</hi> or at leaſt a <hi>purpoſe to worſhip God.</hi> If it be not the worſhip of God, that they need intend; divine worſhip is clearly abandoned, both in <hi>deed,</hi> and in <hi>purpoſe:</hi> if it muſt not be <hi>actual,</hi> there need be actually no thought of worſhipping God. But I cannot diſcern that they count either of theſe neceſſary. They declare plainly that an <hi>actual</hi> intention is needleſs; in this they generally agree, though they differ in the termes, by which they uſe to expreſs it. They call it an <hi>habitual,</hi> or a <hi>vertual,</hi> or an <hi>implicit</hi> intention; in oppoſition to that which is expreſs or actual: So that actually either to worſhip God, or to have an intention of worſhipping him, is more than needs.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60921:23"/> But ſince they will not have it actual, let it be what ſort of intention they pleaſe otherwiſe; yet ſure the thing intended ſhould be the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God: So that they may be ſaid to worſhip in <hi>purpoſe,</hi> though they think it needleſs to do it in <hi>deed.</hi> Whether they count this neceſſary, may be beſt diſcerned by <hi>their</hi> own expreſſions, which they uſe in ſome variety.

As they call that a vertual atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to worſhip, when a man had a purpoſe to attend; though he do it not at all: Anſwerably, a vertual intention to worſhip, will be a purpoſe or thought to have ſuch a purpoſe; though he never have it. Let thoſe, who can, apprehend, how they may be ſaid to worſhip God ſo much as in purpoſe, by vertue of a purpoſe to worſhip him, which they have not, but only intend to have, without effect.

                     <hi>The precept for attending the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of divine ſervice canonically, includes two things: Firſt, that at the beginning of Prayer every one mind what he is going to do.—But for this former it is enough, that it be done by vertue of ſome former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and cuſtome: as if one when the ſign is given for Prayers, go as is the cuſtome, to the Quire-by this he ſatisfies the precept.</hi> Now this he may be accuſtomed to do, without any thought of God, or of worſhipping him: yet by vertue of that <hi>cuſtome,</hi> wherein God is quite neglected, he will have their <hi>vertual</hi> intention to worſhip him: all the intention that they require, that is, plainly none at all; unleſs by vertue of neglecting God, he may be ſaid to mind him.</p>

                     </note> The Church doth not command <hi>internal acts,</hi> no more than judge of them, therefore requires not attention in worſhip: the precept is fully accompliſhed without it, by the <hi>external act</hi> alone; the want of attention is no fault, unleſs upon the account of the natural precept; and in reference to that, it is no worſe than venial. They are herein oppoſed by ſome later Caſuiſts and Jeſuits (however theſe come to be counted more licentious.) But the differing parties fully agree, in making it needleſs to worſhip God. For both hold, that they need not mind either <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>matter,</hi> or the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the words in their ſervice, either actually or vertually: and both conclude, that the words without the ſence (and all elſe for which they can be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) need not be minded actually. All the difference is about a <hi>vertual</hi> attention to the <hi>bare words,</hi> whether the want of that (which is no attention indeed) be a mortal crime. It is juſt, as if when they had concluded it lawful to murther a Man, they ſhould fall into a hot debate, whether it were a deadly crime, to diſorder his hair. But ſo it becomes thoſe who make no ſcruple, to deſtroy Religion Body and

Inward he hath none, when the mind is departed from him, and the heart with it. Outward he hath none, unleſs merely in ſhew, when the mind directs it not to, and deſigns it not for him: which is never done, when he is not minded. In fine by the Doctrine of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> (to ſay nothing of the Idolatry or Superſtition of their ſervice) it is unneceſſary that God ſhould have any real worſhip either publick or private: unleſs God can be ſaid to be truly worſhipped, without the love or fear of God, without acts of wiſdom or affection, without Reverence or Devotion, without ſincere or honeſt intentions; or with deſigns of wickedneſs; without knowing what they do, or heeding what they are about; without mind, or heart, yea or body either, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in mere ſhew, this is apparent by the premiſſes. The people (as they think) worſhip God well enough at this rate; their leaders teach them, no more is needful; their Church by confining their ſervice to an unknown Tongue, makes it neceſſary for their Divines thus to teach, and unavoydable for the people to worſhip no otherwiſe. Now what a Church is this, or of what Religion that makes the real worſhip of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt to be needleſs, and takes an effectual courſe, that he ſhould have none? Let thoſe who are of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or tempted to it, conſider it ſeriouſly, and in the fear of God. Is it the way to Salvation to be without Religion? is there any Religion indeed, where it is made needleſs to worſhip God really, when worſhip is as eſſential to Religion, as a Soul is to a man? They may by joyning with them, greaten a party and promote the intereſt of a faction, which carries on other deſigns under Religious pretences,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60921:51"/> without regard of God, as to his worſhip and honour, or to the Souls of men, as to their happineſs, and the true way to it: but if they follow the conduct of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, and worſhip of God no otherwiſe than theſe would have them; they may be of the Roman Profeſſion, and yet of no Religion. If a man have a mind to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf with none of the realities of Chriſtianity, and yet to paſs for Religious enough, in the opinion of ſo much of the world as is Papal, and will hang his Soul upon ſo common Reputation, Popery is contrived to allure and gratifie him; and he may ſafely venture on it, if Damnation be not dangerous, or if he can eſcape it by an opinion or ſhew of worſhipping God, and being Religious without reality.</p>

                  <p>In the time of <hi>Francis de Victoria,</hi> who lived till the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> had ſate a year, this was the common doctrine, that a man is but obliged to love God once in his life.

                  <p>Thirdly, it will ſuffice, if nothing be done againſt Love, as we heard before out of <hi>Aquinas.</hi> So that when the Precept of love ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth, if we then do nothing contrary to that love, we may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from the act it ſelf, or from acting any thing out of Love.

                     <hi>Maldonate</hi> and others. Now if the precept of Love may be fulfilled by external acts, or by endeavours to obſerve the other commands of God, then it requires not the exerciſe of the inward act of love to him, and ſo there will be no command, <hi>for that,</hi> at all, nor will it be a duty; and all theſe other commands may be ſatisfied without any act of love to God in the heart, and we ſhall love him enough, though we never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any actual love for him in our ſouls.</p>

                     <hi>Grace is a ſufficient cauſe of glory, hence whatever it is, without which grace may be obtained, that is not neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> By which account no act of love (nor of any other grace) will be needful for them, that they may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Thus in fine, here's a Religion which pretends to be Chriſtian, but excuſeth, and diſingageth all that profeſs it, from the love of Chriſt; a Doctrine which bereaves Religion of that which themſelves count its life, and quite ſtifles all the ſpirits of Chriſtianity; chops off all Chriſtian vertues, all gracious acts and qualities, in this one neck, and leaves nothing but a gaſtly Carkaſe. For obliging them to neglect love as needleſs, it makes the reſt impoſſible; without it, there can be no ſaving faith, no godly ſorrow, no filial fear, no delight in God, no deſire to enjoy him, no genuine gratitude. When the life of a true Chriſtian ſhould be made up of theſe; they leave it not poſſible for him to have one act of true Chriſtian vertue: for without love, they ſay themſelves there cannot be any one true vertue. Here is a way to Heaven for thoſe that never loved God in life or death, a path that pretends to Heaven, but lies quite Croſs to the way of Chriſt, and leads directly to <hi>outer darkneſs.</hi> A Doctrine that incourageth them to live in hatred of God all their dayes, and in the end ſends them out of the World under the dreadful ſentence of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 16 22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus, let him be</hi> Anathema, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha. To conclude this head; It is a Doctrine which is damning, not only meritoriouſly, but effectually; and will certainly ruine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally all that believe and practiſe it, and hath in it the mortal poyſon and malignity of a hundred ſuch ſpeculative Opinions, as paſs for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies.</p>
                  <p>And beſide the danger, and horrible impiety of this Doctrine, it is ridiculous to the very higheſt degree. For can any thing be more ſenſeleſs, than to ask how often a man ought to love his beſt friend and Benefactor? whether once in his life be not enough in all Conſcience?
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60921:74"/> nay, whether it be not very fair not to hate him? And indeed they ſtate the buſineſs all along in ſuch a manner, and manage it with ſuch nicety and caution, not as if they were afraid leſt men ſhould love God too little, but as if all the danger lay on the other hand; and their great care were that no body ſhould love him too much, or love him at all. I do not believe that things ſo palpably impious and ridiculous, were ever ſo ſolemnly debated by men of any Religion whatſoever.</p>

                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</label> THat no man can be juſtified or ſaved without <hi>faith,</hi> is ſo evident in Scripture, that none but an Infidel can queſtion it. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do not expreſs any doubt of it; and yet they make no other faith neceſſary, than that which is neither juſtifying, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. They have two ſorts of faith, one for the unlearned and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, which they call <hi>Implicite:</hi> The other for the learned and more knowing, which they ſay ſhould be <hi>Explicite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former as they deſcribe it, is <hi>an aſſent to ſome general including many particulars, with a mind to believe nothing contrary thereunto,</hi> the general is this. That what ever the Roman Church (which cannot err) believes, is true, the particulars included, are they know not what, for they are ſuppoſed ignorant. Now, this we ſay, is no Chriſtian faith; and make it apparent, that it is no ſuch thing. For firſt, it is no belief of any one particular, or article of the Chriſtian faith. It is only a belief of a general, which is no truth at all, much leſs Chriſtian (<hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>cannot err, or believe any thing but what is true</hi>) when the ignorant perſon neither knows what this Church is, nor what ſhe believes, nor why he ſhould give her ſuch credit. So that the <hi>act</hi> is a blind conceit unworthy of a Man, or a Chriſtian; and the <hi>object,</hi> a general error.</p>
                  <p>And then as to the particulars which are neceſſary for Chriſtians to believe, this implicite faith doth not actually believe any of them at
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60921:75"/> all; if it did, it would not be what it is, <hi>implicite.</hi> It apprehends them not, &amp; therefore cannot believe them, for as themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                     <hi>a man is asked, whether Chriſt were born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and whether there be one God, and three perſons; and he anſwers that he knows not, but believes touching theſe things, as the Church holds,</hi> this is to believe implicitely. So that a man may have this faith compleatly, and yet not believe an article of the Creed, and if this be Chriſtian faith, a man may have it, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves nothing of Chriſt. They are believers at this rate, who have a mind to hold, what the Church doth, concerning Chriſt, or the Creed; though they never know, what that is. They know not what the Church holds; unleſs the Churches knowing, be their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and ſo believe nothing, unleſs the Churche's believing be their faith; and ſo have no faith to ſave them, unleſs it be ſaving faith, to believe by an Attorney.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> as this faith may be without the knowledge and belief of any of the particular Articles, which are neceſſary to be believed by Chriſtians; ſo (which is yet more ſtrange) it may be with the belief of what is oppoſite, and repugnant to the Chriſtian faith. This they acknowledge and clear it to us by inſtances. A man may be diſpoſed to believe what the Church holds, and yet may believe that God the Father, and God the Son are not equal, but one greater, and elder than the other, or that the perſons in the Trinity are locally diſtant.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſuch a faith as this, Jewes, and Turks, and Pagans have, even the worſt of theſe, who do but acknowledge a God of truth.

Yea the faith of ſuch Catholicks will be ſo much worſe, than that of theſe Infidels; as it is better to believe Gods veracity and Revelation, than to believe the infallibility of the Roman Church, or the truth of all therein believed.</p>
                  <p>Indeed ſuch a faith was not counted ſufficient for Chriſtians, till Chriſtians were thought to be ſomething like Aſſes. <hi>Aquinas</hi> inquires, whether all be a like obliged to have an explicite ſaith?

                  <p>Thus all ſorts agree in this conceit, which I know not, whether it be more ridiculous or pernicious, that a man's, thinking he hath true Repentance, when he hath it not, is enough (at leaſt with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Abſolution) to ſave him.

                  <p>Here is competent proviſion made, that Sinners may periſh ſecurely, and never look after true Repentance, living or dying. There is but one thing which may ſeem to give ſome check to this great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. Theſe adminiſtrations, whereby they will have the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſaved, depend upon a Prieſt; and the Sinner may be in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances (though this be very rare) wherein a Prieſt cannot be had, and then if he ſhould chance to dye without Contrition, he will periſh. But this need not diſturb any in their courſe of impenitence; for in caſe of neceſſity, where a Prieſt cannot be had, another may ſerve in his ſtead, though he be a Laick, Confeſſion may be made to him, and God will ſupply the want of a Prieſt; ſo <hi>Aquinas</hi> (in 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 17. <hi>q.</hi> 3. <hi>art.</hi> 3.) or he may have the Euchariſt adminiſtred to him without a Prieſt: and it is their common doctrine, that the Euchariſt juſtifies one that is in mortal ſin, if he be attrite, and thinks but himſelf contrite. yea, he may adminiſter it to himſelf with the ſame effect, in caſe of neceſſity: divers of all ſorts amongſt them are of this opinion. The Authority of <hi>Aquinas</hi> is alledged for it, (3. <hi>q.</hi> 82. <hi>art.</hi> 3.) and <hi>Cajetan</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. The example of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> (commonly produced) who having the Sacrament by her, adminiſtred it to her ſelf, is highly approved by all.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:60921:93"/>
                  <p>Thus far Satan has prevailed with them, to promote the Damnation of Sinners, by hardning them in impenitence, even when the intereſt of their Prieſts ſeems a little concerned. But what if a Catholick Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, relying upon ſuch Impoſtors, ſtill neglect true Repentance, and death ſurprize him ſo ſuddenly, as to render theſe other devices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, is not his caſe then deſperate? No, he may have as good hopes of Salvation as other Catholicks have, a probable ground for his hope (and none muſt have any certainty.) Such a ground is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Angelical Doctor, who declares, that if <hi>one ſick deſires pennance, and before the Prieſt comes, he dyes, or is ſpeechleſs; the Prieſt may look on him, as if he had confeſſed, and may abſolve him, being dead,</hi> (Opuſc. 63. de offic. Sacerd.) Accordingly <hi>Clemens</hi> 8. <hi>Abſolved</hi> one whom he ſaw falling from St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Rome, (Molfeſ. t.</hi> 1. <hi>tr.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 48.) So that any may be Abſolved, <hi>i. e.</hi> Pardoned and Sanctified (for the ſenſe of the Prieſts <hi>Abſolvo,</hi> is, <hi>I give thee grace which pardons thy ſins,</hi> Impendo tibi gratiam remiſſivam peccatorum ut communiter Docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, in <hi>Jo. Sanc. diſp.</hi> 27. <hi>n.</hi> 18.) even after they are dead, if they did but deſire confeſſion before. Now thoſe amongſt themſelves, who do not deſire confeſſion while they live, are ſuch only as will not have Salvation if they might, upon the moſt trivial terms, and ſo none need fear Damnation, how impenitent ſoever; otherwiſe they live and dye but ſuch as are worſe than any Devil now in Hell. And who can accuſe them as too rigid, if they make true Repentance unavoidably neceſſary for ſuch as theſe, ſince this doctrine makes it needful for none beſides?</p>
                  <p>All theſe ways any man may be ſaved without true Repentance, if he will believe the Roman Doctors (though if we believe Chriſt, he ſhall certainly periſh that repents not, what-ever courſe he takes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.) Any of theſe are probable, and may be by <hi>their</hi> principles (having grave Doctors, more than enough, to authorize them) ſafely followed; but that of the Councils preſcribing is infallible, and will not fail to ſecure thoſe who practiſe it, if any thing in <hi>their</hi> Church may have credit; nor can fail to ruine thoſe who follow it, if the word of God may be truſted. Thus <hi>while</hi> they would increaſe <hi>their</hi> party, by having it thought, that in their way, ſcarce any <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> will be Damned; they take the courſe (in this, as in other particulars)

For if Attrition be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, as that Council declares, then <hi>true Repentance</hi> is not neceſſary. If grief for ſin, out of ſlaviſh fear, or ſhame only, without any love to God, be enough, then <hi>Love</hi> to God is needleſs; and if Love be not needful, then <hi>Faith,</hi> which <hi>works by Love,</hi> and is the only ſaving Faith, is needleſs, till there be no time for it to work.</p>
                  <p>But is it credible, that they who ſometimes ſeem to lay ſo great ſtreſs upon theſe graces, as neceſſary to ſalvation, ſhould contradict, not only the Scriptures, but themſelves, and make them needleſs, not only all a mans life before, but even when he is dying? ſure, they muſt have ſome device, to ſupply, in pretence at leaſt, the want of theſe; if not before, yet at the point of death, and will ſubſtitute ſomething in <hi>their</hi> ſtead, of ſuppoſed equivalence to them.

And it cannot be denyed, but that pardon can never be had, without true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in Scripture nothing is more evident. He therefore that comes to the Sacrament of Pennance with Attrition only, and ſo without true Repentance; he gets thereby nothing at all: neither pardon, which cannot be had without Repentance; nor infuſed grace, which is never had, without pardon; neither Love, nor Faith working by love, nor Godly ſorrow, nothing that is ſaving; unleſs he can have it without God, or againſt what he hath expreſly declared. So that if he comes to this their Sacrament in a damnable condition, he certainly dyes ſo, for any relief that Rite will afford him. And therefore their Doctrine which incourageth ſinners, to live all their life, without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith, or Love, or Repentance; in confidence that this rite will help them to theſe graces, when they are dying, is a damning impoſture; and their Sacrament of Pennance, a moſt pernicious trap to draw ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (as they ſet and bait it) out of the way of Salvation, whileſt they live; and to plunge them into Hell, when they dye, without any apprehenſion of their danger, till there be no way to eſcape it.</p>

What is this, but to declare, that the moſt damnable neglects and practices ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver damn them, though they never repent thereof, the Church hath a trick to ſecure them notwithſtanding? What is this, but to proclaim that the Lawes of God, and the rules of the Goſpel are unneceſſary impoſitions, without the obſervance whereof Salvation may be had? The knowledge of Chriſt, explicite faith in him, actual love of him (which comprize all the reſt) as they teach, are not neceſſary as <hi>means,</hi> Salvation may be had without them: and as for a neceſſity hereof by vertue of any <hi>Precept,</hi> that is not conſiderable, but in reference to the danger of not obſerving the precept; and there's no danger in this, though the neglect hereof were in their account a mortal ſin, no more than in Venials (or no ſins at all); if it will not damn thoſe, who never truly repent of it.

It promotes the Birth, the Growth, the continuance thereof: for it promiſeth ſafety to impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency therein, yea Salvation too, by a knack of a very eaſie uſe, and new invention.

All the neceſſity laid upon them by the Popiſh profeſſion, is not for ſalvation, but for ſomething elſe: they muſt be <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> but they need not be true Chriſtians; they muſt be the Popes ſubjects, but they need not be Chriſts Diſciples; and this (and the reſt) becauſe they need not learn of him one Chriſtian act while they live.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60921:102"/> neer, not only to diſcharge all acts of Virtue, which are required of Chriſtians, but ſuch alſo as were found even in Pagans. This is grounded upon <hi>their</hi> doctrine concerning venial ſins; theſe with them are not neceſſarily to be avoyded, being either not prohibited by any command (as moſt of them hold), or by no command neceſſary to be obſerved (as ſome of them had rather expreſs it), and therefore no need, that the virtuous acts oppoſite to them ſhould be practiſed. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, no exerciſe of Virtue will be neceſſary, but what is conſiſtent with the vicious acts contrary thereunto, in any degrees of wickedneſs which they think Venial; no acts of Temperance, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Righteouſneſs, Truth, or Faithfulneſs, Chaſtity, Liberality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be needful, but what is conſiſtent with all the Intemperance, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, Unrighteouſneſs, Perfidiouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which by their doctrine is Venial. So he may be <hi>temperate</hi> who ſtill loads his ſtomach till he Vomits, and is daily half drunk. He may be <hi>ſincere</hi> enough, though he always deſign to ſeem better than he is, or good when he is not. He may be a man of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> faithfulneſs, though his conſtant practice be telling Lyes, or breaking promiſes, or ſwearing falſly, ſo all be but in venial meaſures. He may be juſt enough, though in all his dealings, he be continually wronging others in leſſer matters. He may be <hi>Chaſt</hi> enough, though he be unclean in thought, word, and deed venially. And he may be <hi>liberal</hi> enough, though he conſtantly practiſe all the covetouſneſs which is oppoſite to every degree of liberality, ſo it be no worſe. He may be <hi>Religious</hi> enough, though his ſoul never actually worſhip God; and <hi>Devout</hi> enough without any inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and <hi>Reverent</hi> enough, though greatly irreverent, even in the worſhip of God; and though at other times he be ſtill prophaning the Name of God with vain Oaths, and divers ſorts of Blaſphemies: <hi>Holy</hi> enough alſo, though he never have one act of inward holineſs, no not on thoſe days which either God or themſelves have made holy. And in ſhort, he may be <hi>Godly</hi> enough, though he never love, nor fear God till he dye. (Some of theſe particulars are plain by the premiſſes, the reſt will appear ſo when we preſent their account of Venial ſins): So that, though a man were ſo far from expreſſing any Chriſtian Vertue, that he ſhould be inſtead thereof, continually acting the contrary ſins in all degrees not mortal, yet he would not be condemned: For by

Thus may they be deluded, who will truſt their ſouls in this infallible Church. They may be true Catholicks, though they be not Chriſtians, ſo much as to one religious Act; and may paſs cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly to Heaven, though they never move one foot in the way.

                  <p>And ſince encreaſe of Vertue is by the exerciſe of it, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is not neceſſary, the exerciſe is needleſs.

                  <p>Their <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> in aſcribing the peculiar excellencies of the Divine Majeſty, and the prerogatives of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to the bleſſed Virgin, and other Creatures, and to their Popes (though diverſe of them, as themſelves acknowledge, were Monſters and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate Devils) have been ſufficiently diſcovered by others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, deſigning brevity, I here wave them.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame reaſon, I will not inſiſt upon their <hi>Idolatry</hi> in invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Saints, adoring the Hoſt, and worſhipping Images, only as to this laſt, let me obſerve what is leſs taken notice of, that their own Doctrine before opened, quite ſhuts out the beſt, and only conſiderable plea, they make uſe of, to excuſe themſelves from this Crime. It is their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Doctrine, that <hi>the ſame Worſhip is to be given to the Image, and the exemplar, id eſt,</hi> the Worſhip of God to the Images of the Trinity, the Worſhip of Chriſt to a Crucifix, or a Croſs, or the Image of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60921:112"/> Croſs. They alſo define Idolatry, to be, <hi>a giving the Worſhip of God, to any thing elſe beſides God.</hi> Who would imagine, but they had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by faſtened the charge of Idolatry upon themſelves unavoydably? yet they make account to eſcape by pleading that the Worſhip they give to Images is <hi>Tranſient,</hi> not <hi>Terminative, id eſt,</hi> it ſtayes not in the Image, but paſſes from it to the exemplar, the mind of the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per directing it to God. There's no need to ask what ground they have to imagine, that their giving the Worſhip of God to an Image <hi>Tranſitively,</hi> is not Idolatry; it is enough that they acknowledge it to be Idolatry, if it be not <hi>Tranſient:</hi> ſince whatever they pretend when they are pinched, yet they count it not requiſite, that their worſhip ſhould paſs from the Image unto God; but think it ſafe to let it ſtop, where it firſt fell, and terminate in the Image. For they confeſs it paſſeth not to God, without an act of the <hi>mind</hi> directing it to him; this is not, nor can be, when in the Worſhip God is not <hi>minded:</hi> and they generally agree (as was ſhewed before) that they need not <hi>mind</hi> God in their Worſhip. So the reſult of their own Doctrine is, that they need be no better than Idolaters. I know not what they will ſay here, unleſs as <hi>Cajetan,</hi> that a <hi>vertual termination</hi> will ſuffice, <hi>id eſt,</hi> when they have an intention, to terminate their Worſhip on God, without doing it actually, and indeed. But if no more be neceſſary, the Worſhip need not paſs to God really, but may reſt in the Image, and <hi>actually</hi> terminate there: and ſo they will be real, and actual Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, whatever their intention be. Yea as to <hi>that,</hi> by their Doctrine it is not needful, to <hi>intend</hi> to Worſhip God, as we ſaw before. Anſw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably in their prayers to Saints, before their Reliques, or before an Image; (which is their uſual practice) ſince by their common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the perſon prayed to, whether God, or a Creature, need not be <hi>minded,</hi> the addreſs may be actual to the Image, and to that only; the <hi>mind</hi> not transferring the prayer, ſo much as by one thought, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Saint, it will terminate in the Image, if any where, and be as ſenſeleſs Idolatry, as the moſt ſtupid amongſt the Heathen were guilty of.

                  <p>Let me add, that the miſcarriages in their Maſs furniſhes them with many Sacred Reliques, and their orders about the diſaſters there, create for them diverſe objects of Worſhip; and help them to many right Worſhipful things, of the vileſt Vermine, and that which is more loathſome. If the body or blood of Chriſt (ſo they will have it to be) fall to the ground; it muſt be lick'd up, the ground is to be ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and the ſcrapings reduced to aſhes, are to have place among the Reliques. If the blood be ſpilt upon the Altar-cloathes, thoſe cloathes are to be waſhed, and the Sacred <hi>waſh,</hi> is to be inſhrined. If a flye, or a Spider fall into the blood, it is to be taken out, and burnt; and the aſhes put into the holy ſhrine: But if the blood of Chriſt be poyſoned,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60921:114"/> it is to be kept in a clean veſſel among the Reliques; and ſo poyſon becomes a very Worſhipful thing. If a Mouſe, or a Spider, or a Worm eat the body of Chriſt; (I muſt deſire pardon for mentioning ſuch horrid things) theſe Vermine in their aſhes, are to have the ſame preferment, and be put into ſhrines for Reliques. If a Prieſt or other perſon do vomit up the Hoſt, even that (if no mans Stomach will ſerve him devoutly to lick it up) being turned into aſhes, is to be honoured among the Reliques. All theſe and more particulars are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and provided for in the Cautels of the Maſs: and thereby we ſee what order is taken by holy Church, that <hi>dirty water,</hi> the <hi>ſcrapings of the ground, Venemous</hi> or <hi>loathſome Vermine,</hi> yea the <hi>Vomit</hi> of a weak or gluttonous Stomach, caſting up that which they call Jeſus Chriſt; may be inſhrined among the Reliques, which they adore.

The principles of their Religion (for ſuch are determinations of General Councils) bind them to obſerve no faith, or truth or common honeſty with thoſe, whom they count Hereticks, no not when life is concerned. Their Religion obliges them, to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the moſt ſacred Oaths, and the moſt ſolemn ingagements of faith and truth; rather than an Heretick ſhall be ſafe, in any of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, where they can reach him. It is a vertue, a duty in that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſnap aſunder all ſecurities (by which the world and humane ſociety hath hitherto been preſerved) to ruine a Heretick: no fear of perjury, or any other perfidiouſneſs, muſt be a hindrance in the caſe.

The practice of their <hi>Popes</hi> for many ages, may ſatisfie us herein, and to thoſe who are acquainted with Htſtory, which gives an account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is no improbable obſervation, that the bloody Wars and Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, that have been for many Hundred years in thoſe places, which the Papal influence could reach; cannot be imputed to any thing more, for the moſt part, than the Perjuries of the Popes themſelves; and of thoſe whom they involved in that guilt, by diſcharging them from the obligation of their Oaths.</p>

This may ſeem ſtrange, and they croſs themſelves here ſometimes; but nothing muſt ſeem ſtrange in the Maſs, for it is ſuch a heap of abſurdities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, as never entred into the fancy of any men waking, and in their wits; nor could have entred into theirs, if the ſpirit of deluſion, and the dream of infallibility had not diſtracted them. However, this they do, and muſt hold whatever come of it, that Chriſt is killed or deſtroyed in the Maſs; they are as much concerned to do it, as all their Religion comes to; for if Chriſt be not really deſtroyed in their Maſs, they have no true and proper Sacrifice; and they tell us (to prove us altogether irreligious) <note n="(s)" place="bottom">Nulla unquam fuit religio, ſine externo ſacrificio.</note>

'Tis true, Chriſt is above their reach, whatever they fancy, they cannot offer him this violence, or deſtroy him as they do his Members; but they really deſign to deſtroy him, when they would make a Sacrifice of him; and they verily believe they do it, and they do all which they count requiſite in order to it; and therefore they are deſtroyers of Chriſt by their own Rule, <note n="(t)" place="bottom">Voluntas faciendi &amp; ipſum factum ſunt ejuſdem malitiae.</note>

Their Church does it for the honour of the Saints, and of his Mother. In that part of the Maſs, which is called the Offertory, they ſay, we <hi>offer thee this Oblation in honour of the bleſſed</hi> Mary, <hi>for ever a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin, and of all the Apoſtles, and of all the Saints, that it may be for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>

                  <p>Theſe and ſuch like are the prime Vertues of the Romaniſts, moſt needful to be obſerved and practiſed: And if things of ſuch a quality be ſo far from being relinquiſhed, where ſhall we find any thing which God hath made a ſin, that can be thought worthy to be forſaken?

                  <p>If then this <hi>principle</hi> be ſo deſtructive to Religion, the Souls of men, and humane Societies, as ſome of the French <hi>Romaniſts</hi> brand it, in reference to the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> the charge falls upon the common Doctrine of the Roman-Church; for there it is generally taught and received, and was ſo, before <hi>Ignatius</hi> had founded his Order. And this prevents their ordinary exception, againſt our alledging particular Authours againſt them; they cannot with reaſon or modeſty make uſe of this ſhift longer: for a ſingle Doctor is ſo far Authorized, by the common Doctrine of their chief Writers (and ſo of their Church); that any, or all in their Church, have warrant to rely on him. And ſo, in producing a particular Author, in eſteem with them; we do, in effect, alledge their common Doctrine. And indeed by the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the opinion of a grave <hi>Doctor,</hi> is the Doctrine of their Church ſo far, that any of their Church are allow'd to folow it, both as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and practice. Their Church (if we know her ſenſe, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the generality of her approved Authors) does allow all <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> to follow the opinions I have charged them with; though they be plainly deſtructive, of worſhip, faith, and holineſs, both of heart, and life. For I have charged them with nothing, without a conſiderable Authour; and what is ſo grounded, is with them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and what is probable is ſafe, and allowed both as to faith and manners. Or if there be any particular in the charge, in which there
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:60921:217"/> is not a common concurrence, or which is contradicted, though by a multitude of their Writers: yet ſince there is at leaſt one grave <hi>Doctor</hi> for it, it is in their account ſafe; and any <hi>Romaniſt</hi> has liberty by the Doctrine now inſiſted on to follow it (if he pleaſe); rather than that which upon the account of more Aſſertors may be thought <hi>ſafer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as to the purpoſe for which I now take notice of it, this <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> ſerves to rid their <hi>Church</hi> of all ſin; that is, of all Conſcience to avoid any. For if that be ſafe which is probable, and that will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, which is countenanced by the opinion of particular Doctors: then all the ſins which they, or any of them, have already concluded to be no ſins (and theſe are an infinite number) may be ſafely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: and all that any of them hereafter may determine to be no crimes, may be practis'd with as little Conſcience, and as much ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. So that a Train is laid hereby to blow up the whole rule of Chriſtianity, and all innocency and holineſs, which conſiſts in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity thereto: It has done horrible execution already, and what has hitherto eſcaped, is at the mercy of it; being wholly under the <hi>Mine,</hi> and may be diſpatch'd, when ever the Caſuiſts (their Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers) who are daily at work about it, ſhall think fit.</p>

'Tis true they do not acknowledge thoſe practices to be ſins or dangerous; but they may with as good reaſon juſtifie ſuch acts, which they cannot but condemn for crimes, as they go about to excuſe theſe from being criminal. <hi>A ſon of</hi> Belial, that has liv'd in the neglect of holineſs, and in the practice of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and unrighteouſneſs all his time, will ſcarce paſs at the day of Judgment, for one that is <hi>holy,</hi> or innocent; becauſe he has had the confidence to think ſo, or has found out ſome ſhift to ſupport his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; or becauſe others like himſelf, were of the ſame mind; nor is he like to eſcape, becauſe he had wit enough to cozen his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or boldneſs to ſtifle it, or warineſs to keep out the light, which would have inform'd it, or ſelf-love to believe thoſe who flatter'd him, in what his corrupt inclination led him to; or facilneſs to follow thoſe blindfold who had no mind to ſee. Thoſe devices which they have found out to juſtifie innumerable Tranſgreſſions of the Divine Law (and may ſerve as well to juſtifie them all): have no countenance from Scripture, nor from Antiquity faithfully follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. This is not only acknowledged, but charged home by ſome of the <hi>French Romaniſts,</hi> upon a ſuppoſition, that theſe pernicious Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are peculiarly the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> but ſince it is apparent that the <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> of all Orders, and thoſe of Univerſal repute, are no more excuſable; the charge is juſtly fixed upon their Church, and practical Doctrine in general. Nor is their acknowledgment needful, it is plain in the Writings of thoſe, who have the conduct of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that they conſult not with Scripture in theſe determinations, no more than with ancient Writers: you ſhall find them very rarely meddle with either. An allegation out of their <hi>Canon Law,</hi> is an authentick Authority that paſſes for the <hi>Text,</hi> a <hi>Schoolman</hi> or <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> of note, that went before them, is a ſufficient conduct; if there be a concurrence of Five or Six, it is then the common opinion, and they are as ſecure in it as if they marched with a <hi>Caravan;</hi> but if they have a mind to be ſingular, and have but ſomthing like a reaſon for it; they Supererogate, though the reaſon be ſuch, that the next who exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:60921:219"/> it, <hi>puffs</hi> it away as a trifle. Such are the foundations of their practical Divinity; the <hi>Maſters</hi> of it (the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi>) are follow'd by the Prieſts and Confeſſors, and the Prieſts are follow'd by the people: and ſo the blind follow the blind; and thoſe that ſee not, thoſe that will not ſee. But it may be, there was leſs need to be ſo long and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, in ſhewing how unneceſſary it is with them to forſake ſin. It is manifeſt enough by their Doctrine of Repentance, before inſiſted on, that there's no neceſſity they ſhould break off their ſins, till they be obliged to be contrite: and their Doctors cannot agree upon any time for this (though ſome of them ſpecifie the point of death, though then indeed they do not account it indiſpenſably neceſſary): the people may think themſelves excuſed, if they do not reſolve to leave their ſins till their Teachers agree, that they muſt do ſo; and ſo live in them, till they can live no longer. If any particular Doctor fix a more early period, and bring ſome reaſon for it (though they may if they pleaſe, yet) they are not obliged to believe him, for no reaſon is brought by any of them; for a more timely turning from ſin, but is confuted and rejected by ſome or other among them, as ſlight and inſufficient: and 'tis no ſin not to believe him, <hi>who propoſes to them upon frivolous reaſons; yea it would be an act of imprudence to do it, as</hi>

There can be no Religion in reality without real worſhip, this being eſſential to it; yet their doctrine declares it needleſs, either for Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy or People to be real worſhippers of God, being ſo far from ingaging them to be reverent or devout, or ſincere, or affectionate towards God in Religious addreſſes; that it will not have them obliged ſo much as actually to mind God when they pretend to worſhip him. There needs not ſo much as one act of true and real worſhip to make them as Religious, and as much Chriſtians, as is neceſſary by their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. So that Chriſtianity, as they form it, is a Religion regardleſs of God, even when, if ever, he ſhould be moſt obſerved and honoured, and thereby ſunk lower then Heatheniſm, and the notions of natural Religion retained by Infidels. Further, it diſcharges thoſe acts and dutys of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> which are neceſſary and eſſential to it; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and incourages all that it forbids and condemns, even what is moſt repugnant to, and inconſiſtent with it. It makes all Chriſtian acts and dutys needleſs, and all wickedneſs, oppoſite thereto, ſafe and practicable, without fear of condemnation, and there needs no more to ruine the Religion of Chriſt. A great part of thoſe dutys are by this doctrine mere matter of <hi>Counſel,</hi> and thereby they are made no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, all obligation to perform them, being in that notion, quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. The remnant (all conſcience of which is not ſwallowed up in Counſels) which they cannot but acknowledge to be dutys; yet they will have them to be ſo but ſometimes, and that very rarely, and when that is they cannot tell; it is not certainly known when, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance thereof muſt be correſpondent, <hi>no body knows certainly when.</hi>
                     <pb n="410" facs="tcp:60921:230"/> Or if they gueſs at the time, and point ſome out as probable, yet when the time comes, the acts (though the life of Chriſtianity conſiſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the ſalvation of the perſons depends thereon) need not to be done, ſomething elſe will ſerve inſtead thereof, ſome natural act, or faint wiſh, or falſe conceit, ſomething or other, though neither truly Chriſtian nor Virtuous (with the Sacrament at leaſt) will excuſe them from all other Chriſtian acts. It is not the Acceſſaries of Religion only that they make thus bold with; but thus they handle the very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Chriſtianity, and make them unneceſſary for Chriſtians. The very acts of Faith, and Hope, and Love, yea, Repentance it ſelf, and all the reſt with theſe, are thus made needleſs, and they may be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians (at their rate) and ſaved (in their conceit) without ever exerting in a whole life ſo little as one act of grace or Chriſtian vertue. The world never ſaw Chriſtianity, into what hands ſoever it fell, more clearly ſtript, not only of its luſtre and ornament, but of its life and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If this ſuffice not to make an end of all Religion truly Chriſtian, they not only diſmiſs as more than needs, what the doctrine of the Goſpel makes moſt neceſſary, but advance and incourage what is moſt oppoſite to it, not only ignorance, unbelief, diſaffection to Chriſt, impenitency; but therewith all diſobedience unto the Goſpel. Inſtead of the holy rules thereof, they have formed a doctrine of licentious Maxims, which give ſecurity to the practice of any wickedneſs, and take away (when they had left no other reſtraint) the fears of Hell from thoſe who live and dye in damning ſins. Whatever it is that Chriſt forbids, it is with them either <hi>no ſin,</hi> or not <hi>dangerous,</hi> or (the worſt of all by vertue of ſome devices of their own) not <hi>damning.</hi> So that they may venture upon any wickedneſs freely, and perſiſt therein ſecurely till death, and yet by ſome evaſions which they tell them of, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the wrath to come (whatever Chriſt ſay to the contrary), with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either the fruits or acts of Repentance. There are many ſins, and amongſt them horrid and enormous crimes condemned by the Law of God and natural light, and ſuch as the practice of them is reproachful to the Chriſtian name, which yet, with them, paſs for <hi>no</hi> ſins; and they are furniſhed with expedients to make any other ſo too, when they ſee occaſion, and in theſe they will diſcern no ſhadow of danger. There is a world of wickedneſs, which by their doctrine is <hi>Venial,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance more than enough, utterly to deface Chriſtianity, and to
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:60921:230"/> make any (who takes but part of the liberty given by their Divines) to look more like an Athieſt, or a Bruit, a perſon of no Religion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or Honeſty, than a true Chriſtian. They can gratifie any vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition, which way ſoever it leads, with impiety and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches enow to fill up a whole life; and yet (if he will be ſatisfied with any thing, but the higheſt degrees of wickedneſs) promiſe him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
                  <p>If he could ſwallow ten millions of their Venials, every minute at a gulp, they would not (by their divinity) indanger him, though one that will follow the rules of Chriſt, muſt chooſe death, rather than venture upon ſome one of them. There is with them <hi>no danger</hi> in thus ſinning, though the Chriſtian doctrine never diſcovered any thing elſe in ſin. Or if their Catholicks will be outragiouſly wicked, and cannot be ſatisfied with leſs than the practice of the moſt mortal crimes, they will not diſoblige them (the party muſt be kept up, though their ſouls ſink) they ſhall have their liberty upon eaſie terms; deadly ſins ſhall be as free for them, and in a manner as ſafe as their harmleſs Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials. That which makes Venial faults ſeem leſs dangerous than mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; is becauſe they will not damne a man, though he never repent of them; but even herein they have made venial and mortal alike ſafe; for by their doctrine, he may he live in all ſorts of deadly wickedneſs, &amp; die therein without any act of true Repentance, and yet eſcape dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. They commend to them ſeveral evaſions to ſecure impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners, how damnable ſoever their neglects or practices have been to the laſt. But that of the <hi>Trent Council</hi> muſt not be doubted of; <hi>attrition</hi> (which they confeſs alone to be no ſufficient, no ſaving Repentance) with the Sacrament of confeſſion will paſs any Sinner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſaving ſtate. This one device of their own, will ſerve inſtead of all that Chriſt hath preſcribed; if this be obſerved, though they live and die in the neglect of all Chriſtian vertues, and in the practice of all wickedneſs which Chriſt condemns; they need not fear, this alone will ſecure them. <hi>The leſt natural, or ſlaviſh remorſe, and a Prieſt,</hi> is all the Chriſtianity that a Papiſt need trouble himſelf for: if he can but make ſure of theſe at laſt gaſp, he is ſafe, though all his life he be more like a Devil incarnate than a Chriſtian. By this alone Chriſtianity is utterly ſubverted, all the Laws of Chriſt in effect repealed, and their
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:60921:231"/> obſervance rendred needleſs, the whole Goſpel made a Cypher, and a way to ſalvation opened by bold Impoſtors, not only without, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel, and quite croſs to the <hi>Way, the Truth, and the Life.</hi>

It tempts them into the <hi>way of deſtruction,</hi> incourages them in ſuch practice of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as Chriſt hath declared to be the <hi>broad way.</hi> It promiſes ſafety therein, and hides the danger from their eyes; it covers the pits (whoſe deſcent is into that which is bottomleſs) with Spiders webbs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them it is firm ground. It leaves them no ſenſe, nor notice of many ſins; no Conſcience of far the moſt; no fear of any, no not of the worſt, ſuch as themſelves call deadly crimes. It gives as much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to ſuch wickedneſs, as a heart that has <hi>ſold</hi> it ſelf to it, need wiſh. For what need he deſire more than aſſurance, that after a whole life ſpent therein, there is a very eaſie way for him to be ſaved, ſo eaſie that he need not trouble himſelf ſo much as truly to repent? Such grace as any Prieſt can help a Sinner to (an impenitent Sinner) at laſt gaſp, will bring him to Heaven, though he never once thought of the way to it all his life.</p>
                  <p>Such being the rules which <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> have for the conduct of their hearts and lives; and the worſt ſort of them being as much approved by their Church, as any practical doctrine currant amongſt them; let it be conſidered what regard that Church hath of <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Salvation,</hi> which leaves them to ſuch doctrine as is ſo inconſiſtent with both, and what <hi>regard</hi> they have of their ſouls, who after notice here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will truſt them to ſuch a conduct.
